# 1. Herausforderungen

We live in a world where computing has enriched the ecosystem of various fields, be it marketing, human relations and
even agriculture and beekeeping. A question has been asked: How can we improve the way we deal with a beehive better?

The answer to this was obviously computer science. The application __"Sweeter Honey - HiveMind"__ aims to tie together
smart hives with an application that can manage sensors, collect data, and make decisions based on various factors. We
can forget about the time when beekeepers had to check hundreds of hives one after the other. With this application, all
the information is just **one** click away.

The aim of this project is the simulation of different irregular Beehive states and bringing them back to a normal
state.
